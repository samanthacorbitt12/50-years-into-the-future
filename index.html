            With the looming take over of AI it leaves a lot of people in fear of it coming for not only creatives but for computer science related jobs as well. While this is very reasonable to fear and with the regulations of AI in our current time period going unchecked it creates fear and tension in our day to day lives. But this also begs the question, What will technology look like in 50-100 years? AI has progressed rapidly throughout the last couple of years. During COVID AI struggled to produce barely realistic photos often needing photoshop to fix it together. Now that AI has had a chance to advance its database, it’s become increasingly realistic. Now mainstream social media consists of pictures created through the use of AI. Companies are now buying RAM in mass quantities creating an inflation and the prices to increase to 400 dollars per RAM. Employees from tech companies are being laid off now due to companies moving over to AI. Major companies are using AI to create art. Instead of paying artists, people are using AI as therapy, as well as even getting into relationships with AI. With all of these increasingly dangerous issues becoming public and no form of regulations in sight, we can only assume it will continue unless we enforce regulations. 
   50 years into the future, I can see a world that has achieved a dystopian level of perfection. AI right now is polluting our earth and in 50 years I think our resources will definitely diminish. In an article by Adam Zewe from MIT it states, “The computational power required to train generative AI models that often have billions of parameters, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, can demand a staggering amount of electricity, which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions and pressures on the electric grid. Furthermore, deploying these models in real-world applications, enabling millions to use generative AI in their daily lives, and then fine-tuning the models to improve their performance draws large amounts of energy long after a model has been developed. Beyond electricity demands, a great deal of water is needed to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems. The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.
“When we think about the environmental impact of generative AI, it is not just the electricity you consume when you plug the computer in. There are much broader consequences that go out to a system level and persist based on actions that we take,” says Elsa A. Olivetti, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the lead of the Decarbonization Mission of MIT’s new Climate Project.”  With this statement from that article, it's only safe to assume the world’s resources will greatly diminish in the next 50 years. Our children and our children's children will not receive the same resource we have due to this. With that though our children will more than likely have way more advanced technology than we have. The life expectancy would more than likely extend but only to those who have the funds for it. Technology wise, I see the idea of connecting our sensations to the internet with the use of AI. AI seems like an artificial lifeform in of itself. It's a useful tool but it’s almost like a double edged sword. 
  Another statement from the article I found interesting was this, “ While data centers have been around since the 1940s (the first was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1945 to support the first general-purpose digital computer, the ENIAC), the rise of generative AI has dramatically increased the pace of data center construction.

“What is different about generative AI is the power density it requires. Fundamentally, it is just computing, but a generative AI training cluster might consume seven or eight times more energy than a typical computing workload,” says Noman Bashir, lead author of the impact paper, who is a Computing and Climate Impact Fellow at MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC) and a postdoc in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).

Scientists have estimated that the power requirements of data centers in North America increased from 2,688 megawatts at the end of 2022 to 5,341 megawatts at the end of 2023, partly driven by the demands of generative AI. Globally, the electricity consumption of data centers rose to 460 terawatt-hours in 2022. This would have made data centers the 11th largest electricity consumer in the world, between the nations of Saudi Arabia (371 terawatt-hours) and France (463 terawatt-hours), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.”. This means that electricity needs to be produced at a rapid rate to keep up with the growing demands of technology. Unless we find a source to provide that we will not see a change in the conditions we are living in.
